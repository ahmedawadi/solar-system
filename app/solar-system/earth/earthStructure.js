                The atmosphere of the Sun is formed by its outer layers. There are primarily three layers that make up the atmosphere which is named as the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. These are the internal parts of the Sun.

                <span className="text-[#FE0000]">Inner Core : </span>
                The earth's inner core is the innermost geologic layer of the planet Earth. It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 km, which is about 20% of Earth radius or 70% of the Moon's radius. There are no samples of Earth's core accessible for direct measurement, as there are for Earth's mantle.

                <span className="text-[#FE7E00]">Outer Core : </span>
                The outer core, which is liquid, is about 1300 miles (2092 km) thick. Both the inner and outer cores consist primarily of iron and nickel and are extremely hot with temperatures ranging from 7200–9000℉ (4000–5000℃)

                <span className="text-[#EEB329]">Mantle : </span>
                Earth's mantle is a layer of silicate rock between the crust and the outer core. It has a mass of 4.01×10²⁴ kg and thus makes up 67% of the mass of Earth. It has a thickness of 2,900 kilometers making up about 46% of Earth's radius and 84% of Earth's volume.

                <span className="text-[#A8775F]">Crust : </span>
                Earth's crust is made of solid rocks and minerals. Beneath the crust is the mantle, which is also mostly solid rocks and minerals, but punctuated by malleable areas of semi-solid magma.
