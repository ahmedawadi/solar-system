                The atmosphere of the Sun is formed by its outer layers. There are primarily three layers that make up the atmosphere which is named as the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. These are the internal parts of the Sun.

                <span className="text-[#ff4203]">Core : </span>
                The centremost region of the Sun is known as the core; this is the region where Hydrogen turns into Helium through the nuclear fusion reaction. With temperatures believed to be reaching more than 15 million degrees Celsius, the core is considered to be the hottest region of the Sun. When we move towards the outward layers, the density and temperature decrease, and at the centre of the core, it is about 150 g/cm3.

                <span className="text-[#ff8503]">Radiative Zone : </span>
                Between the core and the convection zone, there lies the radiative zone; by means of radiative diffusion and thermal conduction, the energy in this layer transports outside, which travels in the form of electromagnetic radiation by photons. Bouncing from particle to particle, photons transfer energy. At the edge of the radiative zone, the density of this layer reduces from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3.            </p>

                <span className="text-[#fff703]">Convection Zone : </span>
                The outermost layer of the Sunâ€™s interior is known as the convection zone. This zone uses convection mode to transfer energy. The temperature at its base is about 2 million degrees Celsius. The temperature in this zone is low enough for the heavier ions like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron and calcium to hold on to some of their electrons.
